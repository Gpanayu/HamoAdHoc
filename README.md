# HamoAdHoc
This code repository is created to be supplementary materials for CU Toyota Ha:mo Open Innovation Contest 2019.

##### Implementations
1. Python + Scapy library
2. Raspberry Pi 2 + WiFi dongle
3. Have to activate ad-hoc mode in RBP

##### Mechanism
It establishes a small ad-hoc network which communicates their location to check connectivity status. This proves the ability of this type of network. It can be easily implemented and it can be used in the real-world applications. This is a proof of concept that this particular kind of network works. However, for networks with higher number of peers, we need an improved algorithm for communication such as the one that assign unique IDs and fix sending time and sniffing time. This is also not difficult to implement.
